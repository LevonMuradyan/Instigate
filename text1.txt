What is the American Dream? President Franklin Roosevelt explained the
American Dream as freedom of speech and freedom of religion. For the early
immigrants the American Dream was a better life not with material goods, but by
freedom.
Norman Rockwell was a famous artist during the 1930's. Rockwell drew
pictures of the American dream during his time. His art of the American dream
consisted of families having a great time, or of a happily married couple.
Before World War ll the American Dream was happiness with a family or a
loved one. The ending of the war caused the American Dream to change.
Now the American Dream is to become rich. Everyone's dream is to become just
like Bill Gates.People no longer do their work because they enjoy it. They do their
work because of the money.
A perfect example of this is baseball. When Major League Baseball first started
the players did it because they loved the game and loved playing in front of the
huge audiences. They got paid low wages but still played the game because they
loved it. Major League players these days complain because they're not getting paid
enough when they are making millions of dollars a year.
Many American kids set their goal to become a baseball player so that they can
earn millions of dollars too. Americans who hope to use their popularity and luck
for hard work are likely to fail at achieving the American Dream. While those who
find work they love to do and work hard to do it will continue to find their
American Dream.
